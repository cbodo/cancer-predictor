        Cancer Cell Predictor was designed and developed as an interface prototype for a machine learning model. The machine learning model behind the 
        interface uses linear regression to predict whether a cancer cell is benign or malignant. 
        Since the app is only intended to show how a potential user interface might work in an industry environment (i.e. medical labs, 
        clinics, etc.), it is not fully functional. An end-user version would allow for real data input and might include additional input fields.
