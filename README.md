# Cancer Predictor
The website can be viewed at: https://cancer-predictor.fly.dev/

Cancer Cell Predictor is a Flask web application designed and developed using Python 3.11. It is intended to act as an interface prototype for a machine learning model. The machine learning model behind the interface uses linear regression to predict whether a cancer cell is benign or malignant. Since the app is only intended to show how a potential user interface might work in an industry environment (i.e. medical labs, clinics, etc.), it is not fully functional. An end-user version would allow for real data input and might include additional input fields.

The data used to train this model was sourced from the following publicly available dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data/data.

This project was originally developed as a Jupyter Notebook. A link to that Notebook on GitHub is listed below.
